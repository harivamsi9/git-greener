### 🎨 Introduction
Contribution graphs are like gardens, and who doesn't love a lush, green garden? This script sprinkles some digital fertilizer to keep your GitHub contributions flourishing!

### 🚀 Project Activity
Did you notice how active this repository is?
#### After all it has 119 commits!

#### Last update was on Sun Mar 31 at 14:12:47 when those lines were... generated

Yes, generated, because it certainly helps a lot to have such an active repo!

### 💻 Resource Utilization
Oh, and the machine hosting this script (cron updating this file) is operating at **72%** disk usage.
Not the most sophisticated monitoring setup, but it gets the job done with rustic charm!
