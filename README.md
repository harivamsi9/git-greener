### 🎨 Introduction
Contribution graphs are like gardens, and who doesn't love a lush, green garden? This script sprinkles some digital fertilizer to keep your GitHub contributions flourishing!

### 🚀 Project Activity
#####Ever marveled at the apparent activity of a repository?
##### After all it has 45 commits!

##### Last update was on Wed Feb 14 at 04:26:15 when those lines were... generated

Yes, generated, because it certainly helps a lot to have such an active repo!

### 💻 Resource Utilization
Oh, and the machine hosting this script (cron updating this file) is operating at **74%** disk usage.  Not the most sophisticated monitoring setup, but it gets the job done with rustic charm!
