### 🚀 Project Activity
##### Ever marveled at the apparent activity of a repository?
##### After all it has 49 commits!

##### Last update was on Wed Feb 14 at 04:32:33 when those lines were... generated

Yes, generated, because it certainly helps a lot to have such an active repo!

### 💻 Resource Utilization
Oh, and the machine hosting this script (cron updating this file) is operating at **74%** disk usage.
Not the most sophisticated monitoring setup, but it gets the job done with rustic charm!
